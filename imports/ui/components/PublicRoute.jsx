// HOC
// The <PublicRoute /> component is designed as a wrapper component around pages
// that are intended for the public only. By wrapping a component in the <Public >
// component, the intent is to redirect an authenticated user away from this page
// (e.g., a logged in user has no purpose accessing the /login page).
// It follows the exact same pattern as the <AuthRoute /> component, however, running
// its authentication check in reverse.
